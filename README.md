# Traffic-Signal-Violation-Detection-System-Using-Computer-Vision-and-Optical-Character-Recognition
Using computer vision and deep learning to develop a system that addresses road safety concerns by analyzing video and image data to detect vehicle violations of traffic signals. Leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms, object detection, and real-time video analysis, this system supports law enforcement and reduces accidents. SDG 11

1. **Violation Detection**:
   - Automatic identification of vehicles running red lights or ignoring stop signs using YOLOv3 and OpenCV.  
   - Recognition of common violations like speeding through intersections and failing to yield to pedestrians.

2. **License Plate Recognition**:
   - Implementation of OCR to extract vehicle license plate numbers from images and store them in the database and as individual image files, with each filename reflecting the extracted         license plate number.
